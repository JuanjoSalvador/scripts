Bash scripts 
============
### for GNU/Linux Systems

* **Security Copy**. Makes a copy of your /home directory (or other) in other drive.
* **Malware Hunter**. A FAKE anti-malware that shows perfectly how works some fake anti-malwar free software.
* **MvScreen**. Moves all screenshots from your pictures' folder to other folder. This script is written in Spanish, so if you want to use it in a non-spanish system, you need to change some words: "Im√°genes" to "Pictures", and "Capturas de pantalla" to "Screenshots".
